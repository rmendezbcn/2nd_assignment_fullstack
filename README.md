H1 Memory card Game

This is just a simple implementation of the Memory card game.

The application will display a set of cards face down on the screen everytime you start a new game. Your goal is to collect the most pairs of cards.

H2 Rules of the game

- The youngest player goes first. Play then continues in a clockwise direction.
- Each player draws two cards by clicking on them.
- If the two cards match, that players gets 1 point and gets another turn to draw 2 more cards. When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position) and it becomes the next playerâ€™s turn.
- The player with the most points wins the game

The trick of the game is to remember which cards are where to collect the pairs.
Enjoy!
